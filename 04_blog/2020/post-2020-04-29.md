# Resource Files and Simplified Versioning

## Moved to Windows Resource Files

All string literals in the library and in Roller, including all error strings, have been moved into dedicated resource files!

## Moved to Library-wide Versioning

After some research and trial implementation I decided to remove the data-specific versioning I was doing and just version all serialized data by the current library's version.
It's much simpler that way.
If it becomes an issue, each model type can have its own routine to upgrade itself by transforming data and/or providing default values.
So, today my main progress was removing something!
Sweet!
