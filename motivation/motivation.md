## Who Makes Parquet?

Parquet was designed and is primarily developed by me, [Paige Ashlynn](http://mxashlynn.itch.io),
a [fulltime freelance](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paigeashlynn) independent game [coder](https://github.com/mxashlynn) and producer.

Parquet was begun as a learning project to expand my skillset.

Others have contributed ideas and content.

## Why Make a Parquet Game?

Terraria, Dragon Quest Builders 1 & 2, and other very popular games all provide a *narrative adventure* and *feminine self-expression*
through *building* and *quest fulfilment*.
However, so far all such games do this as an afterthought or accidentally -- especially the feminine part.

I believe that I am not the only person who is interested in this kind of play.
For myself and those other players, I want to create games that deliberately center these experiences.

Such games would entail~~
- progression
- exploration
- character interaction
- some degree of simulation
- building/decorating options designed to appeal to femme sensibilities

This final point underlines what many more mainstream building games, notably Minecraft, are missing:
a wealth of mixable/matchable materials and furnishings in a plethora of styles.

This mix of functionally interchangeable yet stylistically distinct articles affords players a great degree of self expression.

## What Parquet Game Have Been Released?

So far, none, as the system itself is not yet ready for production.
In the future some released games will be listed here.
