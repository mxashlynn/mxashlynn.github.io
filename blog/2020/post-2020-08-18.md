# Undo Management

## Tough Stuff

Oof!!
I was expecting implementing Undo to be challengine, but it has been much more challenging than I thought!

It took a significant amount of reading and whiteboarding, but a very basic version of Undo/Redo is now working!

Let's see if I can generalize it so it will work for the whole editor....

## Later That Day

Hurrah!

The existing undo manager is now wired up to the main editor form! :DDD

Set this story to "Needs Review" so that I can make any revisions based on comments from Mint, but the majority of the work is done~~
