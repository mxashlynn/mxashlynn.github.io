# Break Over!

## My Yuri Jam Game

Aaaaand, YuriJam 2020 is done!

I submitted my entry, which turned out quite well if I do say so myself!

I won't talk about it here as there's nice posts elsewhere, but feel free to check it out~~

## Back to Parquet!

So, back to business as usual and continued work on Parquet.
Looking forward to taking the next steps!
