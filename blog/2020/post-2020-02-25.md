# Ready for Roller Work

During load, Parquet now assigns IDs to game entities that are missing them!

The way it does it is pretty bare bones right now.
It doesn't wire up any connections between models ~~ so like, if you make a new Floor called "ceramic tile" and you also make a new Item called "ceramic tile"
so that the player can hold ceramic tiles in their inventory and then place them into the world, both the Item and Floor will be loaded but they won't be connected to one another.

I expect that kind of connection is better handled by a dedicated tool,
like part of Roller or something....
Although it might also be possible to do a name-based search and wire up things like that automatically

Whatever the case, the current level of functionality is fine for now, I think.
This was the last thing that was blocking Mint being able to work on the command line tool-related tasks!

It's also the last Parquet thing I intend to do before my polycule and I go on vacation.
I figure I won't get anything done until after the trip

But yay!
Still honing in on that Version 0.2! :DDD
