# Breaking for Yuri Jam 2020

Whew! A lot of work without much progress in Parquet-land today.

I ran into an error with one of the libraries I was relying on and tried, and failed, to fix it.
But! I did learn a lot while working with it, so it is not wasted time~

Since the library was only being used to assist with documentation, and since I wasn't fully satisfied with it anyway, I decided to go ahead and just turn it off for right now.
A little bit of real work did get done on the backend.

I'm maybe 25% to 33% of the way thru implementing the StrikePanel editor, the part of Scribe that sets up crafting minigame patterns.
This is not strictly neccessary for what I'm thinking of as the first phase of Scribe development,
but I wanted to touch on it a bit to verify some thoughts I had on how some WinForms controlls work.

Scribe might be a little bit usable by others once that's done, though it won't really be any fun until the map editor is ready to go, too

For now, I'm going to take a couple months break from Parquet in order to focus on [Yuri Jam 2020](https://itch.io/jam/yuri-game-jam-2020) :D
