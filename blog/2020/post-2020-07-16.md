# Easy Stuff Done

Got so much done today.
Laid out the item and room recipe tabs, set up the options subscreen, and a bunch of other things I've forgotten.
In fact, it seems I have done all the easy stuff on Scribe and now I need to do the hard stuff! XD
Excited to get to start implementing some of these~!
