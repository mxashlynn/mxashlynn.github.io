# Biome Detection Beginnings

## Development

Got a significant amount of work done on biome detection today, but this is looking like it will be a several-day feature.

The biggest additions today were adding a default "Waste" biome for situations where a region doesn't qualify as any defined biome ~~
something mathematically degenerate, like a region that's mostly empty space or something.
And adding the ability to define biomes based on how many rooms are present in the region (such as for a town).

Before that I also fixed some bugs I found in my recently-added assertions, so that's nice :)

## Nomenclature

Hmmmm, maybe I should pick a more "mathematically degenerate"-sounding name?
I was inspired by the Magic the Gathering concept of Wastes but I can imagine wanting to use "waste" as a legitimate biome name....
Minecraft uses The Void for a similar concept....
I think I like "Expanse".
That's both void-like, generic, and reasonably genre-agnostic....
