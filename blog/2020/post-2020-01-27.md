# Motivation Realization

## Someone to Please

Last night I realized that a thing that makes DQB so much more compelling than other builders for me is the fact that it gives you a role to play.
Terraria was more compelling to me than Minecraft because of the progression, NPCs, and all the femme design elements and details.
But DQB is more compelling than Terraria because of the chance to get to know characters and make them happy.

Fortunately, these kinds of details are already embedded in Parquet, so I think I'm heading in a good-for-Paige direction!

## Higher Dimensions

I wonder if somewhere years down the line it will make sense to make a 3D builder game...?
I have the sneaking suspicion that not too many folks will get that excited to build in top-down 2D.
But I dunno, maybe I'm wrong, Stardew and similar games certainly have plenty of fans

I am definitely going to go all 2D in the stuff I'm working on now as I really prefer it.
I just know a lot of folks like the extra dimension of mobility in their games

## Perspective

Another interesting idea for a builder game would be a diorama-like perspective, such as in Captain Toad Treasure Tracker~~
