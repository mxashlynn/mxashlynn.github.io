# Steady Progress

Slow but steady progress over the last week.
Gradually getting things aligned into a new, simpler API.

Turns out there were a lot of loose ends to tie up in this part of the codebase beyond simply bringing map classes up to date!
Serialization code, for instance, also needed work.
Gonna take a while to get through it all....

Nothing much to show at the moment, but I should be back to doing visible work before the end of next week, I think.
