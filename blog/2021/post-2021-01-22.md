# Welcome .Net 5

I successfully converted Parquet and Scribe from .Net Core 3.1 to the brand-new .Net 5 ~~ and flushed out a bunch of bugs in the process!

Later I'll be looking at items I don't need to implement right now, in order to get a small tech demo up and running, and then trim down my editor goals a bit.

Can't wait to get on to working on the actual engine! ^___^
