# June Progress

This month has been very busy with looking for paying work, so I haven't gotten too much done on Parquet.
That said, I have made progress on both the map editor and engine, which my partner and I have dubbed QutieQueue.

I wasn't initially going to work on the engine until the map editor is done, but my partner has expressed interest in working on the AI routines, so some bare bones need to be in place.
More on all that to come!
