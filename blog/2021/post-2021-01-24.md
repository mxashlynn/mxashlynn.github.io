# Tech Debt Round Up

Cleaned up a lot of tech debt in the main Parquet library today.
The beginning of a new year seemed like a good time to do it, and it helped me get back into the swing of Parquet coding.

Also fixed a lot of small things in Scribe.
As of now I have a few things left before I can start working on a tech demo~~

- World layout editor
- Map editor
- Integrate Roller
- Make Copy & Paste work!! 

One of these is much bigger than the others! XD
