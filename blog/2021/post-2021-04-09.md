# Jekyll, GitHub Pages, and Just-the-Docs

Got an acceptable theme for **parquet.gay** set up.

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Just the Docs](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/)

One of the reasons I went with this one is that it consumes plain markdown files and spits out HTML, so it should be easy to work.
We'll see!
(This is the third thing I've tried for getting the site up and running, so here's hoping! ðŸ˜…)

Still a lot to do, but at least that's some progress.
