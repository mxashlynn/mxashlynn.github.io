# Regions Editor Progress

The entire regions tab now functions, with the big exception of the map editor itself.

Also, talking things over with Solfege has convinced me that I need a visual way to lay out what region is adjacent to what other region,
so I definitely will need that world layou editor.
Added a button to launch it . . . but of course it doesn't exist yet either.

Slow but steady!
