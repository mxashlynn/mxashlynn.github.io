# Small Items

I've now taken care of all of the items on my [list from back in January](post-2021-01-24.html) except for the map editor itself.

That will be a really big one, and based on how long it took me to get the world editor working I expect it to take months.

So, as a break for myself before that, I'm going to tackle some smaller items that have been waiting in the wings.

To Do:
- parquety.gay website blog
- revise color palette
- Scribe tool tips
- Copy & Paste errors
