# Data Load Test

Solid progress today.
I was able to improve the algorithm the layout tool uses; it's proved a more complex problem than I originally expected.

Hopefully will get the rest of it this week and the remaining UI should be quick to fall into place after that. ðŸŒ 

So far the editor doesn't look like much, but it successfully loaded some test data! ðŸŽˆ
