# Towards July 2021

I have set myself a pretty ambitious game jam schedule for the rest of the year,
and next month, July, is the most ambitious of all, with me working on three projects
concurrently in different capacities.

As a result, it might be a slow month for Parquet.

However, I am still focused on the Scribe map editor and I will spend what time I can on it.
Look here for updates as they occur!
