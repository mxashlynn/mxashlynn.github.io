# Parquetverse Collaboration

## Thinking About Future Games

I've come to the point in design and development where I need to start nailing down specific game needs.
Toward this end, I recruited some of my polycule to help me come up with some mechanical and narrative concepts to design around.

I took some time off from coding to work on script writing, design document creation, and paper prototyping.
It still feels weird to be working on this Library-first, so perhaps part of taking this break was to help re-assure the producer in me that some degree of preproduction is happening.

We've come up with some ideas that I think are great.
I think that I will hold off on posting any of them here for the moment, lest someone take them as gameplay promises before the tech stack is even a quarter of the way done, but I am really excited about them.

## the "Parquetverse"

So, none of these game ideas have names yet.
It took forever to land on a name for the library/system that I liked, Parquet, and I'm not too eager to open that can of worms yet for games that may not ever even be made . . .
so for the time being I'm just refering to any games I make in this system as "Parquetverse games".
