# Better Serialization

I feel like I got past a block today!
I devised a good pattern for finishing out the last of the serialization stuff.

Previously I was using a series of shim classes and the CSVHelper class mapper API to bridge between Parquet classes and their serialization details.
Now, I am using CSVHelper's ITypeConverter interface and each Parquet class knows how to serialize itself.
Much simpler and cleaner!

I was hoping to be done with this last week, but this new technique has allowed me to eliminate a buuuuunch of boilerplate and consolidate/simplify things,
so I think it was worth it! ^__^

In case folks are curious:

This shows the serialization routines I am using now, in the section labelled "ITypeConverter Implementation"
