# Mapping Libraries Across Target Platforms

## .Net Core for Gamedev?

Today I learned that .Net Core doesn't support loading unmanaged libraries as well as Mono or .Net Framework did,
leading some game devs to recommend avoiding Core until Microsoft brings that feature to parity.

Specifically, as of January 2020 .Net Core does not automatically map libraries with one name on one platform to another name on another platform.
Worse yet, the library import code does not allow the client developer to provide the mapping either, even when it is known.

There are various workarounds....
But it may be easiest simply to retarget from Core to Framework should that ever become necessary.
On the other hand, it may take so long to finish Parquet that by the time a release is immenent this issue has been solved!

Mostly putting this here as a reminder to myself
