# Slow Progress, New Schedule

Things have been moving really slowly recently, between my dayjob team switching from Unity to Unreal and all sorts of things happening in my personal life.
That's kind of the fate of a side project, I guess!

Gosh, picking up a project you haven't worked on in a couple months is hard! *phew!*
Got myself a bit more organized today, but going to have to spend some time just rereading the code to figure out where things stand~~

But I am working on putting more time into Parquet.
Gonna try out a new schedule where I work on this in the afternoons; wish me luck!
