# Breaking Serialization Down Stream

I'm plugging away at an IO issue that is blocking Mint on finishing up the Roller stories.

In the meantime, here's a fun issue I found today~
- [Enumerable.Empty<T> in .NET Core 3.0 cannot be cast to IList<T>](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/32645)

Fortunately the workaround was easy and kind of fit better with my existing architecture anyway.
Broke serialization in a bunch of other folks' libraries (including Newtonsoft JSON), so at least I can take comfort in that!
