# Room Detection

Woooooooooooo!  The Room detection routine in the library is finally working!

This has been in the works for over a month, since I haven't had as much coding time since starting my new job.

This i sthe  most complex algorithm I've designed in the past few years and it took a lot of white-boarding.

Also, to make it workable I had to tackle some technical debt that had accrued in the library.

With this done, I can finally work on some stories that my collaborators suggested!

In the meantime, I wrote up a bit of documentation explaining [how the algorithm works](https://github.com/mxashlynn/Parquet/blob/main/Documentation/4.-Room_Detection_and_Type_Assignment.md).
