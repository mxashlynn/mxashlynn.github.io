# Shock! My First Public GitHub Comment

For the first time I [commented on a public issue on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-analyzers/issues/2950), to Microsoft themselves no less, so now I'm terrified XD

## Update

Everything went smoothly and they were really nice.  Hurrah!

They pointed me in the right direction as far as complying with the best practice is concerned.
They also pointed out that in my case it might not make sense to worry about it, but as I said~

    For the moment I'm aiming to learn .NET best practices, but in general I would also want to
    balance how much is gained by following a given rule vs the work it takes to implement and maintain it.

This entire project is waaaay more work than it would be if my only goal was to ship, but learning as I go is a major motivator!
