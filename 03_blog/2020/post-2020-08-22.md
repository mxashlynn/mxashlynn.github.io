# More Data Binding

Well, made good progress today.

As I was getting the front end set up I discovered there were some things to do with editing properties that I had forgotten on the backend.
So, I'm knee-deep in fixing that.

However, I'm a good portion of the way through binding the UI elements to actual models.

Hopefully will finish up the first tab this weekend~~

A good thing about having to wire a million UI elements to properties of different classes is that it's a crash course in my own API.
I haven't touched some of this stuff in months and I'm like, "What exactly does this do? Oh yeah!"

So, it gives me a chance to vet my own work a little bit
