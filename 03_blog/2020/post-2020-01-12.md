# CLI Parsing Implemented

Good day's coding today!
The parsing and control flow for the command line tool is done, aaaalmost ready for the functionality to be implemented (I have to add a convenience method to [All](https://github.com/mxashlynn/Parquet/blob/main/ParquetClassLibrary/All.cs) first).

I also have to write user stories for Mint still, which I can hopefully do tomorrow

I spent a while looking at various out-of-the-box command line argument parsing tools available in .Net Core, being most impressed with Dragon Fruit.
But as of this writing, none that met all of my needs are really ready for prime time.
So, since my needs are simple, I decided the shortest route to victory was to [write my own](https://github.com/mxashlynn/Scribe/blob/main/Roller/Roller.cs).
