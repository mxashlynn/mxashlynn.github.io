# Categorizing Parquet Games

## Parquetverse Games

An element of this project that I have not spoken about much publically yet is that I want to ultimately use this library to create a set/series of games.

I've been thinking and reading a lot for years about what kinds of games I'd like to make on my own.

I've been lucky enough so far to be able to choose to work primarily on games the feature and boost marginalized folks, both "on the screen and behind the scenes".
This is definitely something I want to keep doing.

But I've also worked primarily on other people's games.
Now that I've set out to make my own games, I have the opportunity/burden of decididing exactly what those games should be.

## An Underappreciated Audience

At its earliest, this project began as a design question:  "What would Dragon Quest Builders play like if it were constrained to the presentation of Dragon Quest IV?"
The reason I ever asked myself this question, however, is a little deeper.

I've spent over a thousand hours each on Dragon Quest Builders, Dragon Quest Builders 2, and Terraria.
All three are often described as Minecraft clones,
but once you scratch the surface you can quickly see that they are not really much like Minecraft underneath.

For one thing, each of them has a progression of one kind or another.

For another, each one has a degree of village simulation and character interaction.

But perhaps most underappreciated of all, each provides building options that are specifically feminine.
This is true of all three games but is particularly the case for Terraria, which has a wealth of mixable/matchable furniture and materials in a plethora of styles.

These functionally interchangeable yet stylistically distinct furnishings and building materials afford players a much greater degree of self expression than unmodded Minecraft does.

For myself, these three items ~~ progression, character simulation, and feminine self expression ~~ explain why these games are much more compelling than other building or simulation games.

One thing that *does not* make these games more compelling is their combat.
In all three games, the combat is fun, and again Terraria's is especially great.
But that's not what I'm there for.

I believe that I am not the only person who is interested in games that provide a *narrative adventure* and *feminine self-expression* through *building* as the primary mechanic.

This is the primary goal of my Parquetverse games. 

## What Parquetverse Games Are

Expanding on this together with my own values, I was able to derive a definitional set of values to pursue~~

- **Parquetverse Games** {: .numbing}
    - are **Queer & Trans** {: .chemical}
    - are **Femme** {: .extra-bold}
    - are **Colorful** {: .sweet}
    - are **Nonviolent** {: .numbing}
    - are **Anti-Capitalist** {: .fresh}
    - are **Vegan** {: .musty}
    - provide **Happy Endings** {: .cloying}
    - provide **Expressive, Creative Mechanics** {: .zingy}

## Intersecting with the Wider World of Game Dev

There are three distinct movements/niches/communities of game-making that have spoken the most strongly to me~~
- rentpunk
- alt games
- wholesome games

Of these, the alt and wholesome monikers feel most appropriate to my Parquetverse aims.

To recapitulate what others have said summing up these movements:

- **Indie Games** {: .sharp} are independently created but may be mainstream, while
- **Alt Games** {: .floral} are fundamentally not mainstream.

- **Wholesome Games** {: .sweet}
    - have **Lower Stakes** {: .chemical}
    - are **Less Violent** {: .numbing}
    - are **Less Stressful** {: .fresh}
    - have **Positive Themes** {: .cloying}
    - provide **Good Representation of Marginalized Folks** {: .zingy}
    - have **Friendly, Welcoming Aesthetics** {: .sweet}

From this I think it is safe to say~~

So, **Parquetverse** {: .numbing} ⊆ **Wholesome** {: .sweet} ⊆ **Alt** {: .floral} ⊆ **Indie** {: .sharp} Games.

(Where "⊆" means "is a subset of".)

## Criticism
    
Of course, Discourse being Discourse, there has been a lot of pushback and criticism of all three of these movements.
However, as a marginalized person making games I recognize that the only way my work will avoid similar criticism is if it goes entirely unnoticed.
So, I don't believe I'm hurting myself by learning from those who've come before me


All of this is mostly just for my own thinking, but I thought I might as well share! :)
