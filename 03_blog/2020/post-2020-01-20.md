# Serialization Work

Writing this game library has been really good for me, I think.
I'm slooooowly becoming a much better C# coder....

Working my way through what feels like a lot of busywork writing serialization classes at the moment.
Made lots of progress today, but *whew!* serialization turns out to be a complicated business! ^_^U 

The main thing that remains is the region maps~
Once that's done, we should be saving and loading data!

The centerpiece so far is [this class that handles serializing](https://github.com/mxashlynn/Parquet/blob/main/ParquetClassLibrary/GridConverter.cs)
[arbitrary 2D grids](https://github.com/mxashlynn/Parquet/blob/main/ParquetClassLibrary/IGrid.cs)
of [known data types](https://github.com/mxashlynn/Parquet/blob/f4b8857346db6d9296d18279c0b6fd8f56c4352f/ParquetClassLibrary/All.cs#L406).

Gosh, I am not sure what this says about me or my project but I am really starting to chafe at the many limitations of C# generics!
For the first time in my career, I miss C++
Yipes!
