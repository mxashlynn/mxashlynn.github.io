# Towards Proc Gen

Good progress today! Finished rewriting map classes to match the new decomposition.

I have decided to make a very basic/simple "pass-through" procedural generation routine for now.
Thinking about it, I realized it would make more sense to design and debug the proc gen once we can see graphics on screen.

Also, I spent some time this morning looking at the procedural generation routines I wrote for Alas, It Was A Skeleton Monster, aaaaaand . . . I'm not loving it. XD
It's all very hacky and full of magic numbers and not generalized at all.
I feel like I can and should do better for Parquet~~~
