# XML to MD

So far I've been using [Vsxmd](https://github.com/mxashlynn/Vsxmd) to produce MarkDown files from the existing C# XML comments.
It's a nice little build process but it leaves some things to be desired in terms of formatting and file divisions.

So, this weekend I worked on setting up [DocFx](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/) to generate documtation for Parquet.
I got it working but it's pretty messy in terms of its folder structure and the way it integrates with Visual Studio.
Also, it really wants to produce HTML, not MarkDown, so I think I'm going to pass on it.

I also investigated [Sandcastle](https://github.com/EWSoftware/SHFB), but it's aimed at producing windows help files, which is not really adequate

I might just end up doing some work on Vsxmd in order to improve the areas I'm unsatisfied with . . .
or, I might try setting up [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html) with [doxygen2md](https://www.npmjs.com/package/doxygen2md) . . . .
