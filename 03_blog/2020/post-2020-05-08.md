# Adjacency Test

Today I made good progress with help from Solfege, Mint, and Ashley.

I implemented both the new region elevation/adjacency system I was thinking of
and an optional check to ensure that all exits are consistent, if you want them to be.

I feel like this consistency check is over-engineered.
You can look at it here if you like:
- [IMapRegionEdit](https://github.com/mxashlynn/Parquet/blob/spatial-regions/ParquetClassLibrary/Maps/IMapRegionEdit.cs)
I am going to take a whack at simplifying it tomorrow

I feel like I may be able to remove the reflection altogether just by being smarter about where I do my ifs/switches~

Even so, doing it this way was educational!
