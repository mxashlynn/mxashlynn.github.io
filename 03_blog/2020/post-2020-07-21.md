# Steady Progress

Work is coming right along!
Still have to lay out the parquet and beings tabs.
Those are the most complex tabs I am planning to lay out right now, as
I'm going to keep the map editor and script editor on the back burner until I've worked out the kinks in the other items.

Once I've gotten everything laid out, I will start making things actually work! ^__^
