# Nomenclature Update

I renamed the "Entity" classes to "Model" classes.
I think this more accurately reflects their intended purpose and reduces the chance that people will confuse Parquet with an entity-component system 

I ought to write up a thorough explanation of the names in the library, but this will wait until I'm focusing on documentation
