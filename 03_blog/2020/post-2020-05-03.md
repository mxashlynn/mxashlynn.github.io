# Supporting Library Configuration

Today my brain was a little frazzled, so I just worked on adding the ability to configure some of the numbers that manage how the library works,
like how many parquets of a given type are needed to generate a biome or how many chunks make up a sketch.
Also things like minimum walkable spaces to make a room or how many products a crafting recipe can have.
All are now configurable!

Improved some other constants-related things along the way.
Back to work on main dev stuff tomorrow, hopefully!
