# PR Help & Project Tracking

## Code Review Help

As this is my first time designing a large API, I could definitely use some pointers.
My metamour Mint has been kind enough to do code reviews of my changes, and I'm excited to do this going forward.

I'd already been talking with Mint, and several other coders I look up to, regularly during the design and implementation process.
But having someone willing to go through and take a look at each PR is really going to help; I'm super grateful!

There will be done via GitHub's PR system, [here](https://github.com/mxashlynn/Parquet/pulls).

## XXXX

Up until now I have been using GitHub issues to plan and track project progress.
This has the advantage of being visible publically.

However, the reality is that no one is following this project right now and no one will really have a reason to for probably years to come, since it is still in very early stages.
So!  I've decided to move to Clubhouse, the system I use at my day job.

Clubhouse is like an improved Trello -- feature rich, easy to use, and much easier on the eyes than the stark GitHub interface.
Unfortunately, currently there is no easy way to make a Clubhouse workspace visible to the general public, so I will try to update this blog more frequently.
