# Play Design Reference

I haven't gotten much done in the last few weeks as the day job has been very busy, but I did come across this interview with Noriyoshi Fujimoto which could prove useful when considering mechanics~

- [Fine-tuning the balance of sandbox and RPG in Dragon Quest Builders](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/285509/Finetuning_the_balance_of_sandbox_and_RPG_in_Dragon_Quest_Builders.php)

This thought in particular struck me~

  "I wish DQB had a newgame+, where you could replay the main story but with everything unlocked (at least in the sandbox areas)."
