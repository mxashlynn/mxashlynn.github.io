# Potential Tag Line

Still not sure if I want to share info about potential Parquetverse games here, since this blog is supposed to be about the Parquet tech . . . .

But I came up with a draft tagline for the games that I thought I would share, just to give people a sense of the direction I want to go with it~

    ~sappy queerass comfortcore~

Still a draft, but I definitely am all about this sentiment!
