# Documentation Rocks

Dug deeply into the Parquet library code today for the first time in months.

Feeling really good about my comments!
In a way I'm glad I had this months-long absence from coding on it as it gave me a chance to demonstrate to myself that my feelings about commenting are valid ~~
it really is a lot easier to orrient onesself to a codebase that is well-described!

So, this is my current plan:

- Putting the collaborative game design stuff on hold and taking a break from peer code reviews.
- Instead, I am going to work on the library code itself solo for a while.

My aim is build a small model application and some tools.
Once those are finished, then the system will be in a much better position for collaboration

Working alongside Mint a few months ago showed me that I had jumped in too early and that the project is not really ready for others to be contributing just yet

Anyway, thar's yer update!
