## What Is Parquet?

**<span style="color:#6637A4">Parque</span>** is a *game development framework and toolset*, providing mechanics, models, and an editor for 2D quest-driven building and crafting.

The focus is on creativity, character interaction, exploration, and resource gathering.  Parquet is explicitly designed to afford *queer femme self-expression*.

Parquet is scoped to support solo game devs.

## Why Make Parquet?

I began Parquet as a learning project to expand my skillset, but I believe it fills an underserved niche.
Specifically, Parquet exists to develop games that **afford queer femme self-expression through block building**.

That's it, really.  But to be more specific,
-  games made with **<span style="color:#6637A4">Parque</span>**
    - could have these **features**~~
        - creative  **<span style="color:#753D19">Block-Building</span>**
        - **<span style="color:#00715C">Crafting and Foraging</span>** without resource depletion
        - low-stakes **<span style="color:#8F7159">Narrative Progression</span>** with happy endings
        - free-form **<span style="color:#00809B">Exploration</span>** without combat
        - **<span style="color:#1256A9">Low Key Simulation</span>** of community and environmental
        - flexible **<span style="color:#AC276C">Decorating Options</span>**
    - while exhibiting these **qualities**~~
        - are **<span style="color:#C48AFF">Queer & Trans</span>**
        - are **<span style="color:#AC276C">Femme</span>**
        - are **<span style="color:#FCA6BE">Colorful</span>**
        - are **<span style="color:#01CDFC">Nonviolent</span>**
        - are **<span style="color:#00EDB3">Anti-Capitalist</span>**
        - are **<span style="color:#00715C">Vegan</span>**
        - provide **<span style="color:#E13B3B">Happy Endings</span>**
        - provide **<span style="color:#DF7126">Expressive, Creative Mechanics</span>**

## Who Makes Parquet?

Others have [contributed ideas and content](contributors.html) as well!

## Why Make a Parquet Game?

Several popular games provide a *narrative adventure* and *feminine self-expression* through *building* and *quest fulfilment*.
However, so far most games do this as an afterthought or accidentally, especially the feminine part.

I believe that I am not the only person who is interested in this kind of play.
For myself and those other players, I want to create games that deliberately center these experiences.

The point that many mainstream building games are missing, in my view, is a wealth of mixable/matchable materials and furnishings in a plethora of styles.

This mix of functionally interchangeable yet stylistically distinct articles affords players lattitude for self expression.

However, it is more than a question of content.
Mechanically, all existing block-based builder games that I am aware of forefront survival and combat mechanics.
There's nothing wrong with this, but I think there is room for other types of builder games.

Parquet exists in part to ease the creation of builder games which forefront expresive creativity instead.

## What Parquet Game Have Been Released?

So far, none, as the system itself is not yet ready for production.
In the future some released games will be listed here.
