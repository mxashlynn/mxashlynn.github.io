# Parquet

## Game Development Framework and Toolset

**<span style="color:#6637A4">Parque</span>** is a *game development framework and toolset*, providing mechanics, models, and an editor for 2D quest-driven building and crafting.

The focus is on creativity, character interaction, exploration, and resource gathering.  Parquet is explicitly designed to afford *queer femme self-expression*.

Parquet is scoped to support solo game devs.
This site explains how to develop games with Parquet.

For a longer introduction, see the [Motivation](manual/motivation.html) section of the Manual.

## Unfinished!

Currently, both the site and the system are incomplete and under rapid development.
You should expect frequent breaking changes.

For the moment, you can find more information at the [Parquet repository](https://github.com/mxashlynn/Parquet).
