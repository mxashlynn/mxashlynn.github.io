# Parquet

## Game Development Framework and Toolset

Parquet provides *mechanics, models, and an editor* for *2D quest-driven building and crafting*.

Parquet games afford [*queer/femme self-expression through block building*](01_motivation/motivation.html).

Parquet focuses on *narrative adventure and exploration* without combat or resource depletion.

Parquet is scoped to support *solo game devs*.

This site explains how to develop games with Parquet.
Currently, both the site and the system are incomplete and under rapid development.
You should expect frequent breaking changes.

For the moment, you can find more information at the [Parquet repository](https://github.com/mxashlynn/Parquet).
