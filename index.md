# Parquet
## A system for creating queer 2D building, crafting, and narrative sandbox games.


Parquet provides mechanics, models, and an editor for quest-driven builder games.
It particularly aims to support the development of queer games by solo developers.

Parquet is currently in pre-alpha and not yet usable.
You can find more information at the [Parquet repository](https://github.com/mxashlynn/Parquet).

This site is incomplete and under rapid development.
Expect frequent breaking changes.
