# [Parquet Sandbox Game System](https://github.com/mxashlynn/Parquet)
Parquet provides mechanics, models, and an editor for queer 2D building, crafting, and narrative sandbox games.
This site is incomplete and under rapid development. Expect frequent breaking changes.
While the site is created, you can check out <a href="https://github.com/mxashlynn/Parquet" rel="nofollow">Parquet</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mxashlynn/Scribe" rel="nofollow">Scribe</a> on GitHub.
